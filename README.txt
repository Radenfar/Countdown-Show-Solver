Countdown Solver
--------------------
No dependencies required, just unzip and run countdown_bot.py!

Upon loading, follow the prompts and it should become fairly simple how it works.

For words, you enter your letters one by one and it will return the longest possible word with your letters.
For math, enter your numbers one by one and then the target number and it will return all possible paths to that answer.

Amazingly good for both math and words and a fun project to code.
Enjoy beating the contestants!
